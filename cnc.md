# DAY 3 - ELECTRONIC PRODUCTION AND CNC



The day started with an introduction to different machines in the FABLAB.
Our FabLab contains machines like

   - Epilog Mini Laser Cutter
   - Roland CAMM-1 Servo GX-24
   - 3D Printer
   - Vinyl Cutter
   - ShopBot CNC

We were divided into two groups. The first machine that I learnt was ShopBot CNC.


- SHOPBOT CNC


    CNC stands for computer numerical control. A CNC can be used in the production of many different items, such as printed circuit board, door carvings, interior and exterior decorations, wood panels, sign boards, wooden frames, moldings, musical instruments, furniture, and so on.

The main component is a board. We use copper boards even though silver boards are better since the latter is expensive. FR-4 board is used in the lab. There are available i 2  sizes. 
     - 1/32 which is maainly used for cuttting.
     - 1/64 which is mainly ised for hutching
     
The software used  is EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor) , a scriptable electronic design automation application with schematic capture, printed circuit board layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing features. 

- The image for PCB Milling is downloaded from FABMODULES. Now image is opened in the software as input in SPB format. 
- Now select the output form.
- Next select the process foam rough cut(1/8).

And now click save. Now an SPB File will be downloaded.

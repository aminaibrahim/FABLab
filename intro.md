 # Day 1
 

 
 
 The first day at the session was actually an introductory class. Our trainee was Mr. Jaseel Ibnu Muhammed gave an idea about the cocept of FabLab. He just went through the history of Fablab. The origin is in the Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), headed by Prof. Dr. Neil Gershenfeld of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who started a study into the computational capacities that are inherent to physical systems. As a sign of honour, Neil, Father of FabLab described Vigyan Ashram as ‘Fab Lab – 0’.

 Each year members of the more than 1,000 worldwide Fab Labs gather to share, collaborate, explore and, of course, fabricate. In August 2016 the meet up was in Shenzhen, China a historically important city for manufacturing and making. Today China is embarking on a long-term program to foster innovation and technology, so the city is a perfect incubator for the digital fabrication revolution fab labs are bringing to the world.

 Then the next activity of the session is to get introduced to different websites like Thinkiverse, Instructubles, GrabCad etcthat are helpful for getting idea about FabLab. We all made accounts on those sites.
 And that was the end of the session. Intresting.....isnt?

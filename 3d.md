# DAY 6 - 3D PRINTING


- There are different softwares available for 3D printing like RHINOCEROS, SOLOWORKS etc.
- Actually there are product desigh softwares used for jewellery, furniture, ornamental, boat design etc.
- In soloworks, we can do the calculation, assembly directly.
- I used Rhinoceros for 3D model design.


## RHINOCEROS
 - To start a new design, click file -> new .
 - For accuracy, small object(millimeter is selected.
 - In Rhino, 3 views are available namely top, front and perspective.
 - Each cell represents a unit.
 - Different shapes and arcs are available for drawing the model.
 - Different commands like extrude, cap are available for filling options.

- After completing the design, select the complete object.
- Now click File -> export selected.
- Now an .stl file will be saved. Download the file.


## CURA SOFTWARE

- This is a 3D printing software.
- This software is used for converting the stl file into gcode.
- Here we can specify the strength and durability of the materail.
- And also the time ultimaker will take to print the design will also be shown.


I desingned a headset holder and the output 3D model was obtained succesfully.

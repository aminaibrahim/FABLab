There's a range of software that can be used with the laser cutter.

Here's a short list example of software that can be used.

- For raster images:

 Gimp (free software) Gimp Download Information
 Photoshop
(An old but legally free version of Adobe Photoshop can be downloaded: Adobe Photoshop CS2 )

- For vector images:

 DraftSight
 AutoCAD
 Adobe Illustrator
 Inkscape (free software) Download Options for Inkscape
The laser is used with different software as if it's a printer. Different results can be accomplished by adjusting the speed and power of the laser.


Here also we use Rhinocerous software for designing the model.

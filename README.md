#  What is a FabLab?

 FABLAB.. Its merely "a place where we can make almost anything". FabLab digital fabrication laboratories were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technologies. The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist, Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

 At the heart of “FabLab - MESCE” is digital manufacturing technology, combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology. Embracing a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and even PCB Milling. It can produce a single unique product from a digital design in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling methods.

 “FabLab - MESCE” also hosts a number other technologies and equipments which provide broad manufacturing capability, including precision laser  cutters and moulding and milling equipment through electronic  components and circuit boards.
 It was decided to conduct a 2 week training programme for the students to familarise with the machines and technologies.
 
# What inspired me to attend the training?
 
 
  
  The main thing that inspired me was to know what is FabLab. From different people i came to know that our college 'MES College Of Enginnering , Kuttipuram is the only college in the malabar region to have a  FabLab. So as a final year student of this college, I want to know what it is all about.

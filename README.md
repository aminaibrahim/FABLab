#  What is a FabLab?  

 ![fab_lab_logo svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30692869/29262395-f7ab7a18-80f1-11e7-9f60-a073eb889508.png)

 FABLAB.. Its merely "a place where we can make almost anything". FabLab digital fabrication laboratories were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technologies. The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist, Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

 At the heart of “FabLab - MESCE” is digital manufacturing technology, combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology. Embracing a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and even PCB Milling. It can produce a single unique product from a digital design in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling methods.

 “FabLab - MESCE” also hosts a number other technologies and equipments which provide broad manufacturing capability, including precision laser  cutters and moulding and milling equipment through electronic  components and circuit boards.
 It was decided to conduct a 2 week training programme for the students to familarise with the machines and technologies.
 
# What inspired me to attend the training?
 
 
  
  The main thing that inspired me was to know what is FabLab. From different people i came to know that our college 'MES College Of Enginnering , Kuttipuram is the only college in the malabar region to have a  FabLab. So as a final year student of this college, I want to know what it is all about. 
  
  
## A WALK THROUGH THE TRAINING SESSIONS...
  
 # Day 1
 

 
 
 The first day at the session was actually an introductory class. Our trainee was Mr. Jaseel Ibnu Muhammed gave an idea about the cocept of FabLab. He just went through the history of Fablab. The origin is in the Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), headed by Prof. Dr. Neil Gershenfeld of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who started a study into the computational capacities that are inherent to physical systems. As a sign of honour, Neil, Father of FabLab described Vigyan Ashram as ‘Fab Lab – 0’.

 Each year members of the more than 1,000 worldwide Fab Labs gather to share, collaborate, explore and, of course, fabricate. In August 2016 the meet up was in Shenzhen, China a historically important city for manufacturing and making. Today China is embarking on a long-term program to foster innovation and technology, so the city is a perfect incubator for the digital fabrication revolution fab labs are bringing to the world.

 Then the next activity of the session is to get introduced to different websites like Thinkiverse, Instructubles, GrabCad etcthat are helpful for getting idea about FabLab. We all made accounts on those sites.
 And that was the end of the session. Intresting.....isnt?

# Day 2

 
   And there started the much awaited 2nd day of the session.
   
   The main focus of todays session was the importance of documenting using GitHub pages. Good documentation is key to the success of any project. Making documentation accessible enables people to learn about a project; making it easy to update ensures that documentation stays relevant. The trainer gave us a deatiled seesion in how to document the training  sessions. 
   Then we were introduced with the machines in the lab. Our FabLab contains machines like
   - Epilog Mini Laser Cutter
   - Roland CAMM-1 Servo GX-24
   - 3D Printer
   - Vinyl Cutter
   - ShopBot CNC

   We were divided into two groups. The first machine that I learnt was ShopBot CNC.
   
CNC stands for computer numerical control. A CNC can be used in the production of many different items, such as printed circuit board, door carvings, interior and exterior decorations, wood panels, sign boards, wooden frames, moldings, musical instruments, furniture, and so on. 
The main component is a board. We use copper boards even though silver boards are better since the latter is expensive. FR-4 board is used in the lab. There are available i 2  sizes. 
     - 1/32 which is maainly used for cuttting.
     - 1/64 which is mainly ised for hutching
The software used  is EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor) , a scriptable electronic design automation application with schematic capture, printed circuit board layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing features.
